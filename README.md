# AI-CombatGenerator
This is part of my Final Project that I made for my degree (Middlesex University in London).
It just test superiority between few different algorithms:
my custom one,
pick best - that picks always option that has the highest win chance,
GA - rotates around the best possibilities, always looking for better solution.
Together with report (was pretty bad as I am not native English speaker) and presentation this got me 2:1.
